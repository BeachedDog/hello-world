# hello-world
Hello, my name is Kiefer Hillerich.
I am 29 years old. I have a lovely wife whom is currently pregnant with our first child.
I have a degree in chemistry from the university of Louisville. 
I hold a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and am an instructor in Louisville.

I firmly believe it is your moral responsibility to make yourself the person you want to be, regardless of difficulty level.
